                    <span style="font-size: small">BIID has implemented a campaign called e-Krishok 
                    which is designed to bring the benefits of ICT to the farmers of rural 
                    Bangladesh.ICT can be used to deliver services to farmers in rural and remote 
                    locations, and with this information and advisory service farmers can derive 
                    benefit which that farmer would otherwise not have been able to avail.It has 
                    been widely recognized that farmers have limited access to relevant information 
                    and advice whenever they require it.If they have access to such services, 
                    farmers are able to improve their livelihoods,income and hence plan for the 
                    future in a more secure frame of mind.e-Krishok is thus geared to providing 
                    farmers with the information and knowledge that they need at the right time and 
                    at a very reasonable rate.Further information about e-Krishok can be found at <a href="http://www.ekrishok.com"> www.ekrishok.com</a>.<o:p></o:p>A 
                    summary of the achievements of e-Krishok so far is provided below..<o:p></o:p></span></p>
